sugarcrm-bundle
===============

Symfony2 bundle for accessing Sugar CRM REST v10 interface.

Basically, this uses spinegar/sugarcrm7-api-wrapper-class through my
NSQL-Bundle for the REST interface. It's pretty rudeimentaro for now but can
easily be extended.

It's even readonly but that's easy to fix aswell, by adding the write stuff
into the NosqlBundle adapter.
